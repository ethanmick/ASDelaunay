 * http://www.flipcode.com/archives/The_Half-Edge_Data_Structure.shtml
 *
 * The half-edge data structure is called that because instead of storing the edges of the mesh, we store half-edges. As the name implies,
 * a half-edge is a half of an edge and is constructed by splitting an edge down its length. We'll call the two half-edges that make up an edge a pair.
 * Half-edges are directed and the two edges of a pair have opposite directions.
